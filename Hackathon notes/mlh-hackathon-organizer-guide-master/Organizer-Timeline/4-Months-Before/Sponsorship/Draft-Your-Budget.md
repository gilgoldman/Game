# Draft Your Budget

Before you can begin asking for money, get a sense of how much cash you need to pull off your hackathon. Create a [budget template based on estimated costs and your expected number of attendees](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ADKWatCbC3AhBKlyWOtVSqMcD6O6Y3FcwMTZwynPwDA/edit).

Note: We recommend you build in a buffer of $1,000 to $3,000, depending on the size of the event. In our experience, organizers will *always* need this extra money.

## Helpful Figures

Over the years the we've found the averages costs for major budget items are as follows:

- **Food**: $7 per person per meal
- **Snacks & Drinks**: $10 per person
- **T-Shirts**: $5-8 per person (dependent on volume)
- **Busses**: $3,500 per bus
