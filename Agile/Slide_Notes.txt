Notes for Martin:

* Product Vision , slide 7:
	- Is it S.M.A.R.T:
		- Specific: Target is as specific as possible
		- Measurable: Indicator of progress
		- Assignable: Who will do it?
		- Realistic: Can be achieved with current resources
		- Time limited: By when?
	- Does the moon landing vision qualify? Why?

* Elevator Pitch, slide 8:
	* Perhaps a bit clumsy
		- The three models?
			- Why, how, what: Hardest to get right, most powerful
			- Problem, solution, profit: Not too hard to do, usually limited in scope
			- What, so what, now what: Easiest, most flexible

* Siemens Lego City, slide 12:
	- Perhaps we need to specify what is a SCRUM master and how they work before this?


* Dots on slide 14


(?) What's a Cynefin?
