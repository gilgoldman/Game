#Software for Hackathons 

Student Hackathon Organizers have been building software to make manging their events even easier. Take a look at the following software solutions that you could potentially deploy to mange aspects of your event.

## Hacker Identity

* [MyMLH](https://my.mlh.io/) - MyMLH is an API that enables hackers to easily share and manage their data in one click. Integrate it into your apps using **OAuth**.
* [MLH-Hackathon-Boilerplate](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-hackathon-boilerplate) - Boilerplate code for any new MLH Member Hackathon looking to build a website integrated with MyMLH. Written entirely in **Jekyll**, which [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) automatically compiles to make hosting seamless. 
* [omniauth-mlh](https://github.com/MLH/omniauth-mlh) - The official OmniAuth strategy for MyMLH, making it extremely easy to integrate MyMLH into your existing **Ruby/Rails** apps.

## Admissions 

* [Nucleus](https://github.com/hacktx/nucleus) - An extensible and comprehensive hackathon application system that integrates with MyMLH, Slack and more from HackTX. Built using **PHP**. 

## Registration

* [Quill](https://github.com/techx/quill) - A registration system designed especially for hackathons. For hackers, it's a clean and streamlined interface to submit registration and confirmation information. For hackathon organizers, it's an easy way to manage applications, view registration stats, and more! Built using **Node.js** by the HackMIT team.

## Communication

* [Slack](https://slack.com) - A simple, extensible, free to use communication tool that can be used for almost anything at hackathons.

## Mentorship

* [HelpQ](https://github.com/ehzhang/HELPq) - An extensible real-time queue application for mentorship at hackathons. Built using **Meteor** by the HackMIT team.

## Judging

* [Devpost Expo / Table Number App](https://github.com/nealrs/expo) - An expo / table numbers app for your Devpost hackathon. Updated via **CSV** and built using **HTML/CSS/JS**.
* [Gavel](https://github.com/anishathalye/gavel) - A hackathon judging system that uses fancy math to get great results. Built using **Python/Flask** by the HackMIT team.
