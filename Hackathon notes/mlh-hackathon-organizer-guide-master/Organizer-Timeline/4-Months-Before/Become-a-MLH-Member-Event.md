At MLH, our goal is to give you the tools to throw the best hackathon humanly possible, which is why MLH Member events receive the following benefits:

* Mentorship and advice

* Introductions to potential sponsors

* Onsite hackathon support

* Hardware

* Event signage

* Event photography

(You can see the full list [here](https://mlh.io/become-an-official-event). )

The sooner your hackathon gets applies for membership, the more time youâ€™ll have to take advantage of all MLH hookups. To [apply](https://mlh.io/forms/event-sanctioning-request), it must be *at least* 30 days before the event and you should have a confirmed time and location.
