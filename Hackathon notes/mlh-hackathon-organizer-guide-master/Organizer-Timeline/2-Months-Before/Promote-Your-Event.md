# Promote Your Event

When promoting your hackathon, it’s useful to keep in mind that most events have a 50 to 30 percent drop-off in attendance. Given these stats, it’s your goal to over-market and overbook!

## Tell Your Hackathon’s Story

What’s your hackathon’s "brand?" How is it unique? Why would *you* want to attend?

* The more tailored your message, the better. Make it school-specific.

* Use the same messaging to stay consistent and build momentum

* Highlight hackathon benefits perks and the ease of attending: it’s free of cost, transportation will be provided, etc.

It would be great to include a short case study or example "about us" page from a successful hackathon here to show, rather than just tell, organizers how effective branding works.

## Get The Word Out

* Invite students from other schools to attend

    * Select at least three schools within six hours of your campus

    * Look at schools that have previously hosted MLH hackathons

    * Don’t overlook community colleges — they’re often rife with promising participants

* Reach out to student groups and departments on all campuses

    * Groups: ACM & IEEE, SWE, SHPE, etc.

    * Departments: computer science, design, engineering and applied math, physics

* Speak in-person during the first 5 minutes of relevant classes and student group meetings on your campus.

    * Explain what it is, why they should care, when and where it’s being held, and how they can get more info.

* Launch a social media campaign

    * Make a Facebook event page and twitter account. Invite and connect to all your friends and members of on and off-campus hacker groups. Check out the [Florida](floridahackers.com) [Hackers](http://floridahackers.slack.com/signup) [Community](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1023750727698510/) for some examples.

    * Ask other hackathons to tweet about you

    * Consider Facebook ads.

* Get pre-event press coverage

    * Tell your school’s paper

## Resources to get potential pre-event coverage in local and tech media

* Reach out to parent groups (more useful for high school hackathons)

* Share our [Parent Hackathon Guide](https://mlh.io/parent-hackathon-guide) with parent organizations that are interested in hearing about events for their children.
