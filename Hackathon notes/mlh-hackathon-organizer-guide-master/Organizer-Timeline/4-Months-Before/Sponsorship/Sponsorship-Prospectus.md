# Put Together A Sponsorship Prospectus

Before approaching sponsors, create a short info packet with three tiers of sponsorship. [This doesn’t need to be fancy — just explain what a hackathon is and how they can prepare to get the most out of it. You should make it clear what you are providing, and mention a few things sponsors have done at other hackathons that you thought were awesome.](http://news.mlh.io/how-to-throw-an-epic-hackathon-07-07-2014)

Your prospectus should include:

* The basics: date, location, number of expected attendees, etc.

* The story behind your event, an introduction to your team, and a note about what you’re trying to accomplish, as well as what makes your event special. What are its differentiating factors?

* An overview of available sponsorships — what companies get and how much it will cost them.

    * We recommend including three sponsorship tiers: reasonable, moderate, and expensive. (Any one tier should not comprise more than 25 percent of your budget.)

    * Let companies know custom packages are available.

Be sure to include the following info on *all* materials — we can’t tell you how many times this gets overlooked!

* Event name

* Date

* Location

* Projected attendance

* Website URL

* Contact email and phone

When you’re finished reading this section of the guide, we strongly recommend watching our MLH Office Hours about Sponsorship with Tyler Laredo.
