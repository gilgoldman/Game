General notes:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
\o/ It is possible to open a js console (For example, from chrome via "Inspect element")
\o/ replace function replaces something in a string
* console.log returns output to console

* Two types of functions - those that return values and those that perform an
  action that cannot be returned. Try to separate them as much as possible
